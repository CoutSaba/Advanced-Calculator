# 🔢 Advanced Calculator In C++

# 🧮 What The Project Does
This calculator is a console-based application and it serves as multi-functional, <br>
unlike basic calculators that can only do simple arithmetic equations. <br>

# This calculator can perform :<br>

Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>

Rigonometry: Sine (sin) and Cosine (cos) calculations using radian input.<br>

User Interface : A comfortable menu that allows the user to continue performing without needing to restart the app.<br>

Error Handling : It has a built in safety check to prevent any type of common errors. <br>

# 💻 Which Technologies Are Used<br>

Language: C++ (ISO Standard).<br>

Standard Libraries :<br>
                     "iostream" For handling user input and output.<br>
                     "cmath"    For access to advanced mathematical functions like sin, cos and sqrt.<br>
                     "string"   For text-based input.<br>

Ai Integretion :<br>
Ai was used to optimize the "Switch Case" logic and to identify "Edge Case" for the code to work steadily.<br>

# 🧠 Future Improvements<br>
The following features could be added to this project to make it a professional-grade tool:<br>

Graphical User Interface (GUI):<br> 
Using libraries like Qt or SFML, a windowed application can replace a black-and-white console.<br>
Instead of entering numbers one at a time, expression parsing enables users to type an entire equation (such as 5 + (3 * 2)).<br>

Memory Functions:<br> 
To store and retrieve past computation results, add M+, M-, and MR features.<br>

Unit Conversion:<br> 
Including modules for temperature, weight, and currency conversion.<br>
